        Data structures and algorithms are essential concepts for any
        programmer. They are the building blocks of computer science and
        software engineering. In this course, we will explore the fundamental
        data structures and algorithms used in C programming language.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">The course will cover the following topics:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Programming Basics</li>
        <li>Arrays and Pointers</li>
        <li>Linked Lists</li>
        <li>Stacks and Queues</li>
        <li>Trees</li>
        <li>Sorting and Searching Algorithms</li>
        <li>Graph Algorithms</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the
        core data structures and algorithms used in C programming, and you will
        be able to apply these concepts to solve real-world programming
        problems.
